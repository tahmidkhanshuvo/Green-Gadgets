## Green Gadgets Vision

Green Gadgets is driven by a vision of sustainability and innovation. Our mission is to empower environmentally-conscious consumers by providing a platform that promotes the recycling, refurbishment, and reuse of electronic devices. By connecting users with high-quality recycled and refurbished products, Green Gadgets not only helps reduce electronic waste but also makes cutting-edge technology more affordable and accessible.

This project embodies our commitment to green technology and social responsibility. As a CSE2200 project, it was proudly developed by Tahmid Khan, Tahmid Amir, and Saobia Islam Tinni, whose passion for leveraging technology to create a positive environmental impact is at the core of Green Gadgets.

Our goal is to inspire a shift toward sustainable consumer habits and foster an ecosystem where innovation meets eco-friendly practices. With every interaction on Green Gadgets, we hope to contribute to a greener future for our community and beyond.
